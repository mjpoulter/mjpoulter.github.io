 Added comments to the blog. Now you all get to tell me what you think.

 I added to my previous post about the remnants of Windsurf being snapped up Cognition. Better outcome for the employees for sure and gives Cognition an IDE to augment their Dylan agents. And Windsurf gets access to Anthropic's models again, having been cutoff during the Openai discussions.

 In other news AWS announced their entrant into the IDE and agentic coding world. Playing catchup.. Its a vscode fork.. thats a theme of course.. downloaded it and set it up but havent had a chance to use it yet.. but as its also tied to Anthropic if feels like we wont get much we haven't seen before. Still waiting to see how Anthropic play this.. lots of folks using Claude to drive their tools and now Claude Code competing with them..

 Rushed post to celebrate adding comments.. i'll try to be more thoughtful in future.
