 I wasnt sure how i would go about this initially but as i looked around at my options for posting, using Github Pages and markdown seemed a very logical option, and after a few days of wrestling with Jekyll (thankfully i have mac and not just windows machines).. Ive been able to put together the site and produce this first blog post.

 I was incented to push ahead on reading about the failed OpenAI/Windsurf deal and the subsequent acquihire of the key staff at Windsurf by Google. Now the open question is can Cursor survive independently. Their dependence on Anthropic is clear both for capability and expenses, and Claude Code seems to be the new big game in town. Are they going to be able to differentiate long term. Similarly all the agents startups that will now have to compete with Anthropic etc.. Interesting times for sure.. 

 More to come as i get used to this was of posting and get into a rhythm with my thought snippets.
