Lots of news this past week related to big proposed investments by OpenAI together with Oracle and then a big investment by Nvidia, who are continuing to be helping fuel the boom by reinvesting their gpu windfall back into the cycle. Im not convinced this is to be believed. Lots of trees grow the sky projections and all being built on debt.

Not sure this ends well. There are those who say we should compare this the industrial revolution. But there were bubbles there as well eg overbuilding of railways in the UK. The debt makes it worse, especially as much of it is using the gpu's and datacenters as collateral, which is very much like the dark fiber overbuild in internet bubble. There were survivors from that bubble, but others didnt make it. Ironicall Sun was a victim who were acquired by Oracle. I wonder who acquires Oracle if this doesnt end well and given their leverage, and Larry's it might not. Investment is needed for sure, but much of this feels hyped and excessive, and the push to use natural gas and other non-renewable energy sources as part of the rapid buildout also feels problematic.

In other news the Dora report for 2025 was released, and Rachel Stephens of Redmonk had a good article summarizing her reaction. which is that addressing just coding isnt solving the development productivity problem, not withstanding all the hype. i have confirmation bias there of course. i believe in the value of the tools but only when deployed thoughtfully.

Btw context engineering is replacing prompt engineering. I'll try to write more about that soon.

There was also a promising approach to building a world model for code generation from meta. Some intereesting work around code traces vs just code. Its open and looking forward to how they take this forward. I truly believe more of the systems execution environment and context is needed to get to fully agentic flows.

And last but not least a great interview with Richard Sutton.

This all continues to move apace. News every day.
