There were a couple of big cases last week that go to the heart of the value of content. The first was the news that Google dodged a potentially fatal finding in their anti-trust case. No breakup, no spinouts, but they do have to share their search index information. The mechanics of that arent yet clear, but the judge, clearly taking into account the changing landscape and competition for Googledue to LLMs found that Google's monopoly position in search and the need to share the data that drives that to remedy that monopoly was key to curing the complaint against them. Really cementing the idea that in the current landscape of training AI models, content is more valuable than ever.

The second case is Anthropic's copyright breach trial, where they won an initial victory relative to fair use but were found at fault for downloading/pirating books that they then used for training. Anthropic announced last week that they had reached a settlement with the plaintiffs that would compensate them to the tune of approx $3k per pirated book, which seems low to me, but apparently the plaintiffs thought it was the best they could do. It seems the judge in the case isnt convinced. So we'll see how this finally plays out. <https://apnews.com/article/anthropic-authors-book-settlement-ai-copyright-claude-b282fe615338bf1f98ad97cb82e978a1>

Ive also been reading about individuals and companies that are starting to record all their activities to produce content for model training, and the possibility of companies like cursor being compensated for access to the developer interaction transcripts while using their tools. Which along with Anthropic now shifting to mining the interaction data with their tools further emphasizes that content is king. We'll see how that shifts if folks are able to generate high quality content via simulations, perhaps from initial world models, but it feels intuitive that recording the activities and judgements of expert professionals will provide valuable specific data. Then how are those folks compensated? Seems like the tension between the creators and the model companies is here to stay, unless there is some agreed compensation system, perhaps along the lines of cloudflares suggestions. <https://blog.cloudflare.com/content-independence-day-no-ai-crawl-without-compensation/> More to come i suspect.
