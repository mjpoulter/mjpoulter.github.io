There have been a lot of discussions of late about why enterprise adoption of GenAI is taking longer than might be expected, given the potential benefits. I think this partly a function of the usual path that new technologies take to be adopted into the preexiting enterprise ecosystems. But in the case of GenAI i think there is a bigger "crossing the chasm" problem than usual. Im in agreement with Adrian Cockcroft, who has made the point that you always have the "crossing the chasm" problem with any new technologies when you move from the early adopters to the early majority, mainstream adoption. But in this case, the technology is changing/improving so quickly that there is no stable approach that the early adopters have proven out, for the early majority to adopt, and so they might have toe in the water pilots/pocs etc, but are not in a place to settle on something to adopt. Im not sure what the answer is, but its something the product companies, and AI labs need to figure out if their capabilities are going to get traction. I doubt they are going to slow down their pace of innovation, but at some point they need to think about LTS versions of their capabilities that will give enterprises a stable target and the promise of some longer term support so that they can adopt and support at a pace they can accommodate. Its hard to see broad adoption in established enterprises otherwise.
