i got wrapped up last week trying to figure out the right time to write something given everything that was going on, but it got late enough in the week that i decided to hold off and just skip a week. I guess going forward i should just post on a monday regardless of the news cycle.

So the news cycle had the openai restructuring, which gives them a runway to an IPO and clarifies their relationship with microsoft, which was following this week by them announcing a big deal with amazon for capacity. Hard to find someone they dont have a capacity deal with now. And the big cloud players continue to ink deals either to supply capacity or buy capacity from others, eg microsoft with lambda. Satya commented on friday that they are power constrained and may have chips on the shelf waiting for datacenter capacity to install. All of that will continue it seems.

The major tech companies all announced earnings last week, all surprised to the upside, all talked about continued investment in capacity to service AI needs, only Meta was second guessed as they dont have the fallback of a cloud business to support their investment, their use cases being all internal, with no real clear payoff

Nvidia GTX was in DC, and the keynote was a rendition of all that is Nvidia but nothing earth shattering. In fact the "Pre-game show" was more interesting as it had some good panel discussions.

Cursor had a big new release, including their first custom LLM trained with a software development perspective, they got mixed feedback, im sure they'll work through the feedback. Hype proceeded the reality, but given their history so far im sure they'll respond and adjust. They also seem, along with cognition to have realized they need to be able to service the enterprise needs and not just vibe coders.

More interesting is that we are finally starting to get some folks with real world experience running agents (largely for software development tasks) starting to report out on their experience. And its reinforcing some of the things you'd expect. You need to take a structured thoughtful software engineering approach to get real benefit. Which isnt really too surprising to practicioners, but against the vibe coding mantra. Though many folks are now equating vibe coding to low code, no code, RAD use cases and not serious software engineering use cases, in particular not in brown field environments. Hopefully things will start to settle around that bifurcation and we'll see more folks focussing on serious tooling for software/systems engineering for the enterprise.

A couple of examples from AWS.

May be too much to expect, given where we are in the hype cycle, but renditions that focus on real world problems, such as these, and all the attendant security issues around mcp and agents and how to protect against them would help ground folks in how to utilize the technology, which is where most enterprises are struggling. Separting reality from hype is also important to see from the purveyors of solutions. It will actually help them get traction and past the POCs and pilots.

It continues to be a full time job to stay up to date and try to do that hype filtering.
