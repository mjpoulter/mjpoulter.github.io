Light blog this week. Im gonna blame it on the US Thanksgiving holiday, and the inevitable cold i caught as result of having lots of people around a table.

Having said that there were more reinforcing signals that we probably arent getting AGI any day soon and that new approaches will be needed to get where we need to be for models to continuously learn, which i think is becoming the bar we need to get over. In particular Ilya Sutskever was on the Dwarkesh podcast and added his weighty imprint to the debate. Definitely worth a listen. I undoubtedly have lots of confirmation bias here, but i think his views are sufficiently well informed that it should be hard to dismiss him. Enjoy.
