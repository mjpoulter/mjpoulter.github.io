Some interesting developments last week. The blow out numbers from Nvidia didnt assuage the concerns of overinvestment. After an initial pop, the stock dropped. Also the investment by Microsoft and Nvidia in Anthropic with Anthropic then spending money back with Microsoft and Nvidia for cloud use and chips fueled the discussion about circular investments, and Michael Burry is sufficiently energized by all that, that he's deregistered his hedge fund and moved in to newsletter publishing <https://www.cnbc.com/2025/11/24/michael-burry-launches-newsletter-to-lay-out-his-ai-bubble-views-after-deregistering-hedge-fund.html> .

Reality bites?

Also Google's release of Gemimi 3 dented the OpenAI and Anthropic as the leaders in frontier models perspective, with leading edge performance, along with new software development tools (Antigravity), likely from their windsurf leadership acquisition, setting them up as strong competitors. And they did it with no meaningful break throughs, just improved execution on pre and post training. And then today Anthropic released <https://www.anthropic.com/news/claude-opus-4-5> to strike back. Interestingly the announcement has a big focus on software development, which as we've said before seems to be the first persistent sticky use case with real revenue. But the leap frogging shows that, as per the famous Google memo, there really is no moat. While it might not be open models (though the chinese seem bent on that approach to destabilize the US frontier labs), it at least shows that they frontier efforts dont really have unique capabilities or IP and that its all in access to capital and talent and execution. ie. No moat, other than a product moat. And i think that will be hard to sustain given how fast things are changing.

I think this all goes back to us needing to be more pragmatic about how AI will be adopted and where the value will accrue. I think a blog today from Jeffrey Snover encapsulates it well. He's had a few recently that are in line with my own thinking, but i particularly like the gpu's aging like fish analogy.

I think this really is like any tech cycle. Adoption takes time. If the technology moves too quickly its very difficult for the average enterprise to keep up and be able to adopt. And so they pause and wait for things to settle down. Adrian Cockcroft has made the point that its hard to "cross the chasm" if the technology changes before you can get there. you are constantly in the world of the innovators and early adopters and can never really get the early majority engaged.

I think we are starting to get some balance back into the conversation. Hopefully the pragmatism and realism will prevail and we'll get less hype and more practical adoptable solutions. Even in software development, which is clearly a sweet spot for the current tools, a little less swirl and more stable implementations of mcp and agents and other tooling will help with broad adoption. 

With the pace of change it may only be next week before something else material changes. We'll see!! At the moment robotics has started to get more hype and investment again. I think there its harder to fake it. But the hype continues. A humanoid robot in every home. Self driving cars everywhere. Ideally there would be less faking more making

 i think we would all like more of that, fact and not fiction, before reality bites.
