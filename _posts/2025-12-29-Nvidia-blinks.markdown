So the big news of last week was the deal Nvidia did with Groq
<https://groq.com/newsroom/groq-and-nvidia-enter-non-exclusive-inference-technology-licensing-agreement-to-accelerate-ai-inference-at-global-scale>

Structured to give the illusion of continued competition, its clearly a sign that Nvidia has realized that the game is moving to low power, low latency, cost effective inference and that no matter all the prior marketing statementsgpu's arent the right solution to that problem.

Credit them for recognizing the need to pivot, of course its clearly anti-competitive, but unlikely to be challenged in the current regulatory environment, they didnt wait to find out if TPU's and similar chips were going to be a meaningful threat, but just acted.

In other Nvidia news, it seems they have retreated from the plan to push themselves as a cloud provider with DGX cloud. Again credit to them for pivoting when they realized that plan wasnt working, Jensen clearly isnt shy about changing his mind when a thesis proves to be wrong.

So the question now is where does the competition come from and can anybody really challenge them. I think the first order is to abstract away their CUDA advantage via approaches like Mojo, but also someone is going to have to figure out how to deliver a better overall inference solution, that can extend to the edge which is where the winner will finally be established. Maybe Qualcomm, or Apple will break the stranglehold by being successful at the edge and then extending to the datacenter, maybe Intel via the rumored sambanova acquisition or perhaps one of the neuromorphic approaches will finally deliver. But if someone doesnt figure it out soon, Nvidia will continue to dominate, and potentially extract monopoly revenues into the future.

As always, we will at some point find out.
