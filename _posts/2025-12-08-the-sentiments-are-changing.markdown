The major happenings this last week were AWS re:Invent and the NeurIPS conference.

AWS had its usual set of keynotes and announcements. They seemed to be trying very hard to show that they were ahead of the game because they were focused on Agents and not just simply providing LLM based tools. It all felt a little forced and me too. The only piece that i found interesting was the participation of Byron Cook who leads their Neurosymbolic practice and has been key in their use of formal proofs. If they can make formal methods more accessible and use them to show that the output from agents is "correct"..ie it matches the specs, then i think that would be a real advance. Promising at least and interesting to see Byron, supreme geek participating in the keynote. Fastcompany also did a profile of him <https://www.fastcompany.com/91446331/amazon-byron-cook-ai-artificial-intelligence-automated-reasoning-neurosymbolic-hallucination-logic>.

NeurIPS had a large attendance and some interesting papers, but to me the most interesting aspect was that more people were talking about needing new approaches, in particular approaches where the models continue to learn as humans do, if we are going to get to the next level of capability. David Luan, who heads AI research at Amazon, said that he thought it was guaranteed that the way models are being trained today isnt going to last.

Last piece of interesting news was that Naveen Rao's new startup got funded and they are starting their work on an analog approach to neural computing <https://unconv.ai/introducing-unconventional-ai/>. He did a good interview with a16z that gives his perspective. <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZ4DT20OHXE>

The pace isnt slowing. OpenAI in a code red to try to recapture mindshare, lots of product releases, and now researches looking for other approaches. Its looking like an interesting 2026.
