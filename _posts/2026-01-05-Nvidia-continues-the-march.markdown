Happy New Year!

I wasnt intending to post this week as last week was quiet and ive been working on pulling together my thoughts on how im thinking about the future of software engineering as the capability of development agents continues, and folks like cursor with their graphite acquisition are moving to address some of the current bottlenecks. So more to come there. However Nvidia dropped the news at CES yesterday in a Jensen keynote that Vera Rubin platform (along with a new kv cache storage layer) is already in early production with ramp up for later in the year, with significant performance and power enhancements relative to Blackwell. So relentless execution and interesting impact on the value of Blackwell which calls into question the projected 5-7 year useful life of that platform(on some folks books at least). I now understand why Microsoft delayed some of their build out to not be long Blackwell with the iminent arrive of the new platforms, Vera Rubin now and the next gen quickly following. Not clear at all what that does to the debt that is secured against prior generations of gpu's. As always.. Time will tell.
