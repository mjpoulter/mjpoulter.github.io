I'll not spend a lot of time on GPT5 not living up to the hype.. There's been plenty of press on that, not to mention Altman agreeing that there's a GenAI bubble?. Instead the news that i thought was most meaningful this week was the news that Microsoft is going to end Github's independence and absorb it into Microsoft proper, reporting to Jay Parekh with Thomas Dohmke leaving, to "return to startup life". <https://github.blog/news-insights/company-news/goodbye-github/>

 It was spun as Thomas leaving and so then Github being absorbed, but it doesn't feel that way. If Microsoft was ok with them remaining independent they could have appointed a new CEO as they did when Nat Friedman left. Instead it feels like Microsoft wants to have control of Github Copilot, which is probably the only real money maker for them in the GenAI space.

Ive got to think that this will backfire on them, and its clearly the beginning of the end of Github as we've known it. As they absorb them into the mainstream of Microsoft, you've got to think that Hubbers will start to look for alternatives, and you've got think that those who dont want to entrust their repo's and other capabilities to Microsoft will also look for alternatives. Some have stayed with Github after Microsoft's acquisition because they were operated at arm's length. That fig leaf is now gone and so many opensource developers will start to think about alternatives (eg Codeberg), and many independent developers will start to think twice about copilot, especially as there are plenty of credible alternatives now. Maybe im wrong and everything will continue as before. But i doubt it. RIP Github.
