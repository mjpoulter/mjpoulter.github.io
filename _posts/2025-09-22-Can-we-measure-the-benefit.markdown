Busy news week again, Nvidia investing in Intel, reminded me of microsoft investing in apple back in the day, and they also did a network startup acquihire. There was the Meta announcements. More speculation on OpenAI's spending, Anthropic not playing ball with the adminstration, lots of new features in coding tools and agents, but the news items that caught my eye were a couple of developer analytics related events.

Nicole Forsgren, who is a DORA, SPACE co-creator and author, has left microsoft for google to work on developer intelligence in their core engineering organization as she put in her linkedin post

"I'll be diving into how Google's developers really work - what makes them productive, what slows them down, how they build and ship. We'll share the insights along the way to help the whole developer community.
This feels like perfect timing too, since AI is flipping software development on its head. Understanding what developers actually need right now feels more important than ever"

Couldnt agree more with the sentiment, and looking forward to what she finds and shares. Very interesting that Google, who have more experience than most with both measuring developer activity and AI for software development are still looking to get more sense of what is needed to keep improving.

And then there was the big news of Atlassian acquiring DX. Ive spent time with the DX folks and really respect their perspective and approach, so i think its great that they now have the backing of Atlassian and the ability to tie tighter into some of the Atlassian tools like Jira. Coincidentally, earlier in the week i was reading a blog post on the pragmatic engineer by Laura Tacho of DX, which was an interesting reading on the topic of measuring engineering effectiveness, experience, productivity etc in the context of GenAI tools. Worth a read <https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/how-tech-companies-measure-the-impact-of-ai>

Ive been working in the area of developer e's. ie. enablement, excellence, experience, effectiveness in a focused way for about the last 4 years, and still havent really got comfortable that i have any holistic solution to the problem of defining the metrics that matter, and the advent of GenAI coding assistants and agents has just served to further complicate the space. We have a terrible habit of measuring what we can vs what we should, and some things are still mostly subjective, which is then of course subject to subject and observer bias (hence some engineers feeling like AI is speeding them up when it demonstrably isnt). Its a space i continue to work on, but i think its going to be key to be able to have a way to both show the concrete benefits (which im not sure is at all easy today) and more important, where are the bottlenecks and pitfalls that prevent us from really unlocking the value. Feels like early days but im optimistic that folks like the Nicole and the DX team will help push things forward. And i'll keep working on it too! But without some hard data, leaders are going to start to be reluctant to continue to invest, especially if things move from subscriptions to usage based pricing models, which is how things seem to be going. They will want evidence of value.

Its going to be interesting to see how it plays out. Feels very much like the early days of cloud when the skeptics wanted to see the roi and strategic value. You know the value is there in the right context with the right approach. But you do need to be able to get past "trust me" and demonstrate it. And its the same here. If you have a good approach to leveraging the technology, reducing cognitive load and friction and guarding against codebase decay, then you will see the value. But you need to be able to demonstrate that and you need to be able to detect when you get off track.

Much more to come in this space im sure.
