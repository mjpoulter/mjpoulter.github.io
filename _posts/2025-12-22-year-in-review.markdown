We are in the season of year in review for 2025 posts and predictions for 2026. Of the review posts ive seen i like the one from Andrej Karpathy. <https://karpathy.bearblog.dev/year-in-review-2025/>. Worth a quick read. And there was a podcast interview in the deepmind podcast sequence with Demis Hassabis that is worth a listen also. Always interesting to get his perspective.

Another post i felt was worth mentioning, because i think it succinctly captures how we should think about the responsibilities of developers as they use GenAI tools, came from Simon Willison. <https://simonwillison.net/2025/Dec/18/code-proven-to-work/>. Indeed you can't/shouldn't deliver code that has been validated, just because it was created by an LLM. Whether you are in the loop or reviewing post creation, you are still responsible for ensure the code functions and meets the requirements stated in the specs.

More prediction stories coming over the next week i expect. But the work to go beyond LLMs is starting to get traction and so i expect to see much more of that in 2026. Maybe it will indeed be a year of research, but i fear the revenue pressures will continue to push the hype that LLMs will get us to General/Super intelligence, and unfortunately i think its becoming very clear the current scaling approach wont get us there. I think we'll see even the big labs starting to look for other breakthroughs, just not stating the need publicly. More to come!
