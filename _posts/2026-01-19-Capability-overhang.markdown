Natural follow on to last weeks post where i talked about the difficulty of crossing the chasm. Apparently the new concern the AI labs are concerned about is "capability overhang". It seems this thesis is that the LLMs and the harnesses that leverage them are capable of wonderful things that folks arent yet leveraging. Which is a little bit of a realization that the "Field of Dreams" approach isnt working and that perhaps they need to figure out how to make the technology actually useful to real enterprises.

To quote Sarah Friar: "AI capability is advancing at extraordinary speed. But adoption, understanding, and real-world use are not keeping pace. That gap, between what AI can do and who is actually benefiting, is now one of the defining economic questions of the next decade." and of course this is a big slug of enlightened self-interest. Because if there isnt meaningful take up of paying customers, where is the money coming from to keep this merry go round going?

Lets see if the bright minds in Davos this week have any meaningful insights. Not holding my breath!
