Big news for last week was the announcement of the formation of the Agentic AI foundation, under the linux foundation umbrella, with many of the leading AI platform companies participating as founding members. Antropic donated MCP, OpenAI donated agents.md and Block donated their goose agentic framework.

Interestingly at the moment their isnt much representation from the startups that are building agentic solutions. eg. cognition etc. Maybe they think they can just consume without needing to influcence, or more likely they are young enough they dont really understand how all this works yet. Regardless good to see enlightened self interest at work.

On a related note, and maybe just as important, it seems that OpenAI are emulating Anthropics Claude skills approach. Not sure its been an announced thing, but its been reported by folks like Simon Willison, who thinks its just as big as MCP, which i think is probably true, and also has the same sort of concerns around security and usage as MCP. <https://simonwillison.net/2025/Dec/12/openai-skills/>

Everything continues to move at pace that is hard to keep up with. Which i think continues to reinforce the concern that its hard for enterprises to adopt these technologies when things are constantly changing. Crossing the chasm is i think going to be a real challenge, but if these companies want to get to meaningful revenue from enterprise customers, outside of the software development use case, which is getting traction, then there are going to have to be ways to generate some stable offerings while the leading edge continues to evolve quickly.

One approach that im seeing get traction, is that product companies are following the palantir playbook of having forward deployed engineers/solution architects working with customers to help them adopt, and even some startups (one at least being sued by palantir) just acting as a pool of forward deployed engineers to allow multiple vendors access to the talent to allow customers to adopt. It talks somewhat to the solutions needing to be more accessible/adoptable going forward, maybe the foundations allow for that also, or perhaps the hyperscaler offerings become easier to consume, with LTS type versions of things, but it feels we are ways to go before we get to that point. 

On the topic of whether or not LLMs get us to superintelligence, the consensus seems to be building (outside of openai and anthropic?) that we need some breakthrough in continuous learning to get there. Google has their nested learning approach they published <https://research.google/blog/introducing-nested-learning-a-new-ml-paradigm-for-continual-learning/> and some others have also looked at hierarchical approaches, but nothing that seems like a breakthrough has been reported yet. Though i think with all the money in play we are likely to get less public disclosures of methods in the short term.

Definitely interesting times.
