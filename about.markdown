I am (now) a (semi)retired techonologist, with a passion for reading and musing on the implications of all the current happenings in technology.. and a penchant for projecting/predicting what comes next. And mostly in relation to technologies and companies that will make it and those that wont, particularly in an enterprise setting. I have long history of posting such musing internally to my employers, and while retiring was encouraged to continue.
